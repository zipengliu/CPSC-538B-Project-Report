We propose an interactive visual tools for developers to understand system traces of
distributed systems.
Users can quickly have a mental model of an approximate finite state machine model of 
the system being inspected, understand the communication patterns that cause the
transition of states and the invariants of the system execution.  Pangaea can be
also used for detecting anomalies, which might be traced back to bugs in the program
or design deficiencies.
